        Bengaluru (also called Bangalore) is the capital of India's southern
        Karnataka state. The center of India's high-tech industry, the city is
        also known for its parks and nightlife. By Cubbon Park, Vidhana Soudha
        is a Neo-Dravidian legislative building. Former royal residences include
        19th-century Bangalore Palace, modeled after England’s Windsor Castle,
        and Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace, an 18th-century teak structure.
